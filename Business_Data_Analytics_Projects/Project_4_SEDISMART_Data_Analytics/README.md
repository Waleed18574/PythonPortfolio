Python Data Analytics Project: SEDISMART Supply Chain Analytics

Intro:
SEDISMART is an imaginary office furniture & equipment company based in UK, and its management executives have a meeting soon in which they discuss the business status. The executives would like to see:
- The general KPIs and business metrics of the business (#CEO board).
- The performance of the sales-people (#HR team).
- The performance of their customers (#marketing team).
- The performance of their products (#sales team).
- The performance of their suppliers (#logistics team).
- The forecast of the revenue for the first quarter of the year 2017 (#finance team).

Tasks:
- Calculated the business #KPIs and displayed them in dynamic presentation.
- showed the performance of the sales-people based on the revenue associated with them.
- Showed the top customers by revenue with filtering by branch and year features.
- Segmented the #customers using RFM analysis, and clustered them based on the Income-level and RFM score.
- Segmented the #suppliers based on the revenue and the risk associated with the products they supply using Kraljic quadrants.
- Showed the locations of suppliers on a map visual.
- Segmented the products based on the ABC analysis.
- Showed the top performing products with filtering by branch and year features.
- Provided 2 products recommendation lists as examples; one using user-based approach and another using product-based approach.
- Conducted time series analysis and forecasted the revenue for the first quarter of 2017; I compared the #MAE of the traditional method of calculating the values of p,d,q with that best method using grid search and selected the model with the lowest MAE.

The document attached highlights just some of the visuals in the project to provide brief overview.

Libraries used: #numpy, #pandas, #matplotlib, #seaborn, #floium, #ipywidgets, #sklearn, #statsmodels and #pmdarima.

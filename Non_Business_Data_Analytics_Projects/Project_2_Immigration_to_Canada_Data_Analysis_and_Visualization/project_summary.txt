Python Data Analysis Portfolio Project: Immigration to Canda Analysis

Dataset: Immigration to Canada by Country of Origin
Dataset Source: UN Population Division
Type of Analysis: Exploratory and Time Series and Forecasting


Summary:
In the first part of this project, I collected and cleaned that data. Then, I wrote flexibel functions that return the basic 
statistics and visualizations of a given data-frame. Next, I used thos functions to show the countries with the largest number
of immigration from Africa, Europe, Asia, Latin America and North America. The code can be modified to show the countries with
the lowest numbers of immigration.

Moreover, I compared the immigration timelines from the major three countries invloved in the Balkan war in th 1990s and 
compared the timelines of immigrations from USA to Canada vs. Canada to USA.

In the second part, I outlined the country with the largest total immgration number and conducted a time series analysis on
its timeline, then I built a forecasting model using Grid Search and ARIMA to forecast the immigration from that country.
